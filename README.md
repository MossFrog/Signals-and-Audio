# Signals-and-Audio
A small program created in C++ for the Signals course at the University of Maribor.

The program accepts any OGG/WAV file with a sampling frequency of 44100Hz and then creates multiple outputs with lower bit depths and sampling frequencies.

Supports recording audio directly from a microphone.

The program also renders the waveform statically in multiple colors.

Controls

- Hold 'R' to record audio.
- Press 'P' to playback audio and update the waveform rendering.
- Press 'C' to change the Waveform color.
